Introduction
------------
The Combined Cache System is a sophisticated caching solution designed to optimize data retrieval by leveraging a blend of Least Recently Used (LRU) and Least Frequently Used (LFU) caching strategies. This system is tailored for environments where fast read access is crucial, and consistency in multi-threaded operations is paramount.

Features
--------
- **LRU and LFU Combination:** Utilizes a mix of LRU and LFU caching strategies to store and access data efficiently.
- **Immutable Data Structures:** Employs immutable data structures to ensure thread-safe read operations.
- **Asynchronous Write Operations:** Queues write/update actions for processing in a background thread.
- **Cross-Platform File Storage:** Leverages the `appdirs` package to determine storage locations, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
- **Graceful Shutdown:** Includes mechanisms to save the cache state to a file during application shutdown.

Design Considerations
---------------------
The design of the Combined Cache System focuses on several key aspects:

- **Read and Write Efficiency:** Balances fast read access with consistent and orderly write operations.
- **Thread Safety:** Ensures safe access in a multi-threaded environment using locks and immutable data structures.
- **Data Consistency:** Maintains cache consistency, especially when handling multiple concurrent write operations.
- **Scalability:** Designed to be effective for a wide range of workloads and adaptable to different usage patterns.

Implementation Details
----------------------
The cache system is implemented in Python, with the following components:

- **LRU Cache:** A sub-component that tracks the most recently accessed items.
- **LFU Cache:** A sub-component that keeps count of item access frequencies.
- **Update Queue:** A thread-safe queue that manages write operations.
- **Background Processing:** A dedicated thread for processing queued updates.

Usage
-----
To use the Combined Cache System:

1. Initialize the cache.
2. Access or update items using the `access_item` method.
3. Retrieve the combined cache state using `get_combined_cache`.
4. On application shutdown, call `shutdown` to save the cache state.

.. code-block:: python

   cache = CombinedCache()
   cache.access_item("item1")
   combined_cache = cache.get_combined_cache()
   cache.shutdown()

Thread Safety Considerations
----------------------------
The cache system ensures thread safety through:

- **Locking Mechanisms:** Utilizes locks to manage concurrent read and write access.
- **Immutable Snapshots:** Uses immutable data structures to allow uninterrupted read access during write operations.

Performance Implications
------------------------
The design choices made in the Combined Cache System aim to balance performance with consistency:

- **Lock Duration:** The lock covers the entire update process, prioritizing consistency over potential performance gains from a more relaxed locking strategy.
- **Read Optimization:** Read operations are designed to be fast and non-blocking.
- **Update Queuing:** Write operations are queued and processed asynchronously to prevent blocking reads.

Conclusion
----------
The Combined Cache System offers a robust and efficient caching solution, suitable for applications where fast read access and data consistency in a multi-threaded environment are crucial. Its design is a thoughtful balance of different caching strategies and concurrency control mechanisms.
